# MLG-TextClassification
This is my project for CS6604
This project explores graph-based approaches for text classification using heterogeneous graph neural networks (GNNs) and citation-based Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). The work includes modeling relationships between documents, authors, and tags, and incorporates synthetic metadata for enriching the AG News dataset. Additionally, we experiment with a GCN on the Cora citation dataset for comparison.
The repo does not include the .pt data files to save space
